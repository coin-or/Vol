\section{Introduction}

Here we describe an implementation of the Volume algorithm (VA) originally
presented in \cite{BA}. We focus on the {\it uncapacitated facility location
problem} (UFLP) as an example, see \cite{BC} for some of the theoretical
issues. As a first step, a new user should be able to run our code ``as is''.
This can also be used as a framework for Lagrangian relaxation. The user would
have to modify the files {\tt ufl.hpp}, {\tt ufl.cpp}, {\tt ufl.par}, and {\tt
data}, to produce an implementation for a different problem. The files {\tt
volume.hpp} and {\tt volume.cpp} are specific to the VA, so the user should
not have to change them. We hope to receive reports about bugs and/or
successful experiences.

\smallskip

Initially this directory contains the files: {\tt INSTALL, Makefile,
  volume.hpp, volume.cpp, ufl.hpp, ufl.cpp, ufl.par, data, doc.ps}. See the
  {\tt INSTALL} file for instructions on installation.

Now we present the linear program used in \cite{BC}. This is
\begin{eqnarray}
\min \sum c_{ij} x_{ij} & + & \sum f_i y_i  \label{fp1} \\
\sum_i x_{ij} & = & 1, \hbox{ for all } j,  \label{fp2} \\
x_{ij} & \leq & y_i, \hbox{ for all } i, j, \label{fp3} \\
x_{ij} & \ge  & 0, \hbox{ for all } i, j,   \label{fp4} \\ 
y_i    & \le  & 1, \hbox{ for all } i.      \label{fp5}
\end{eqnarray}

Here the variables $y$ correspond to the locations, and the variables $x$
represent connections between customers and locations. Let $u_j$ be a set of
Lagrange multipliers for equations (\ref{fp2}). When we dualize equations
(\ref{fp2}), we obtain the {\it lagrangian problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}
L(u) & = & \min \sum \bar c_{ij} x_{ij} + \sum \bar f_i y_i + \sum u_j, \\
x_{ij} & \le & y_i, \hbox{ for all } i, j, \\
x_{ij} & \ge & 0, \hbox{ for all } i, j, \\
y_i    & \le & 1, \hbox{ for all } i.
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent Where the {\it reduced costs} $\bar c_{ij}=c_{ij}-u_j$, and
$\bar f_i = f_i$. We apply the VA to maximize $L(\cdot)$ and to produce a
primal vector $(\bar x, \bar y)$ that is an approximate solution of
(\ref{fp1})-(\ref{fp5}). Using this primal information we run a heuristic
that gives an integer solution.

In what follows we describe the different files in this directory.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{ufl.par}

This file contains a set of parameters that control the algorithm and contain
some information about the data. Each line has the format

{\tt keyword=value}

\noindent where {\tt keyword} should start in the first column. If we add any
other character in the first column, the line is ignored or considered as a
comment. The file looks as below

\bigskip
\begin{verbatim}
fdata=data
*dualfile=dual.txt
dual_savefile=dual.txt
int_savefile=int_sol.txt
h_iter=100

printflag=3
printinvl=5
heurinvl=10

greentestinvl=1
yellowtestinvl=4
redtestinvl=10

lambdainit=0.1
alphainit=0.1
alphamin=0.0001
alphafactor=0.5
alphaint=50

maxsgriters=2000
primal_abs_precision=0.02
gap_abs_precision=0.
gap_rel_precision=0.01
granularity=0.
\end{verbatim}

The first group of parameters are specific to the UFLP and the user should
define them. {\tt fdata} is the name of the file containing the data. {\tt
dualfile} is the name of a file containing an initial dual vector. If we add
an extra character at the beginning ({\tt *dualfile}) this line is ignored,
this means that no initial dual vector is given. {\tt dual\_savefile} is the
name of a file where we save the final dual vector. If this line is missing,
then the dual vector is not saved. {\tt int\_savefile} is the name of a file
to save the best integer solution found by the heuristic procedure, if this
line is missing, then this vector is not saved. {\tt h\_iter} is the number of
times that the heuristic is run after the VA has finished.

The remaining parameters are specific to the VA. See the {\tt VOL\_parms.html}
file for their documentation (this file will be created after doing a `make
doc` or it's available on the Internet).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{data}

The file {\tt data} has the following format. On the first line we have the
number of possible locations and the number of customers. On the next lines,
the cost of opening each location appears, one cost per line. Then each of the
remaining lines is like

$
i \quad j \quad d_{ij},
$

\noindent where $i$ refers to a location, $j$ refers to a customer, and
$d_{ij}$ is the cost of serving customer $j$ from location $i$. The indices
$i$ and $j$ start from 1. If a pair $i,j$ is missing then the cost $d_{ij}$ is
set to $10^7$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{ufl.hpp}

This file contains C++ classes specific to the UFLP.

First we have a class of parameters specific to the UFLP. The description
of these parameters appears in the preceding section.

\begin{verbatim}
class UFL_parms {
public:
   string fdata;         // file with the data
   string dualfile;      // file with an initial dual solution
   string dual_savefile; // file to save final dual solution
   string int_savefile;  // file to save primal integer solution
   int h_iter;           // number of times that the primal heuristic will be
                         // run after termination of the volume algorithm
   
   UFL_parms(const char* filename);
   ~UFL_parms() {}
};
\end{verbatim}

Before the next class we should mention the classes {\tt VOL\_dvector} and
{\tt VOL\_ivector} defined in {\tt Volume.hpp}. The pseudo-code below
illustrates their use. 

\begin{verbatim}
int n=100; 
VOL_dvector x(n);  // a double vector with n entries 
x=0.;              // sets to 0. all entries of x 
VOL_dvector y;     // a double vector, it size remains to be set 
y.allocate(n);     // size is set
y=x;               // copy each entry of x into y 
VOL_dvector z(y);  // a double vector of the same size as y, 
                   // all entries of y are copied into z 
x[0]=-1;           // first entry of x is set to -1 
y[0]=x[0];         // copy first entry of x into first entry of y
\end{verbatim}

The class {\tt VOL\_ivector} is used for vectors of {\tt int}. One can do the
same operations as for {\tt VOL\_dvector}.

Then we have a class containing the data for the UFLP.

\begin{verbatim}
class UFL\_data { // original data for uncapacitated facility location
public:
   VOL_dvector fcost; // cost for opening facilities
   VOL_dvector dist;  // cost for connecting a customer to a facility
   VOL_dvector fix;   // vector saying if some variables should be fixed
                      // if fix=-1 nothing is fixed
   int ncust, nloc;   // number of customers, number of locations
   VOL_ivector ix;    // best integer feasible solution so far
   double      icost; // value of best integer feasible solution 
public:
   UFL_data() : icost(DBL_MAX) {}
   ~UFL\_data() {}  
};
\end{verbatim}

Then we have

\begin{verbatim}
class UFL_hook : public VOL_user_hooks {
public:
   // for all hooks: return value of -1 means that volume should quit
   // compute reduced costs
   int compute_rc(void * user_data, 
                  const VOL_dvector& u, VOL_dvector& rc);
   // solve lagrangian problem
   int solve_subproblem(void * user_data, 
                        const VOL_dvector& u, const VOL_dvector& rc,
                        double& lcost, VOL_dvector& x, VOL_dvector&v,
                        double& pcost);
   // primal heuristic
   // return DBL_MAX in heur_val if feas sol wasn't/was found 
   int heuristics(void * user_data, const VOL_problem& p, 
                  const VOL_dvector& x, double& heur_val);
};
\end{verbatim}

Here the function {\tt compute\_rc} is used to compute reduced costs. In the
function {\tt solve\_subproblem} we solve the lagrangian problem. In {\tt
heuristics} we run a heuristic to produce a primal integer solution.

Finally in this file we have {\tt UFL\_parms::UFL\_parms(const char
*filename)}, where we read the values for the members of {\tt UFL\_parms}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{ufl.cpp}

This file contains several functions that we describe below.

First we have {\tt int main(int argc, char* argv[])}. In here we initialize
the classes described in {\tt ufl.hpp}, and read the data. Then {\tt
volp.psize()} is set to the number of primal variables, and {\tt volp.dsize()}
is set to the number of dual variables. Then we check if a dual solution is
provided and if so we read it.

For the UFLP all relaxed constraints are equations, so the dual variables are
unrestricted. In this case we do not have to set bounds for the dual
variables. If we have inequalities of the type $ax \ge b$, then we have to set
the lower bounds of their dual variables equal to 0. If we had constraints of
the type type $ax \le b$, then we have to set the upper bounds of their
variables equal to 0. This would be done as in the pseudo-code below.

\begin{verbatim}
// first the lower bounds to -inf, upper bounds to inf 
volp.dual_lb.allocate(volp.dsize);
volp.dual_lb = -1e31;
volp.dual_ub.allocate(volp.dsize);
volp.dual_ub = 1e31;
// now go through the relaxed constraints and change the lb of the ax >= b
// constrains to 0, and change the ub of the ax <= b constrains to 0.
for (i = 0; i < volp.dsize; ++i) {
   if ("constraint i is '<=' ") {
      volp.dual_ub[i] = 0;
   }
   if ("constraint i is '>=' ") {
      volp.dual_lb[i] = 0;
   }
}
\end{verbatim}

The function {\tt volp.solve} invokes the VA. After completion we compute the
violation of the fractional primal solution obtained. This vector is {\tt
psol}. Then we check if the user provided the name of a file to save the dual
solution. If so, we save it. Then we run the primal heuristic using {\tt psol}
as an input. Notice that this heuristic has also been run periodically during
the execution of the VA. Then if the user has provided the name of a file to
save the integer heuristic solution, we do it. Finally the values of the
solutions and some statistics are printed.

The next function is {\tt void UFL\_read\_data(const char* fname, UFL\_data\&
data)}, where we read the data. {\tt data.nloc} is the number of locations,
{\tt data.ncust} is the number of customers. {\tt data.fcost} is a vector
containing the cost of opening each location. {\tt data.dist} is a vector
containing the cost of serving customers from facilities. All entries are
initialized to $10^7$ and then particular entries are being set with the
statement

{\tt dist[(i-1)*ncust + j-1]=cost;}

\noindent where {\tt i} is the index of a location and {\tt j} is the index
of a customer. Here the indices start from 1. Finally we have a vector {\tt
data.fix} associated with the locations. A particular entry is set to 0 if the
location should be closed, it is set to 1 if it should be open, and it is set
to -1 if this variable is free. Initially all entries are set to -1.

In the function 

{\tt double solve\_it(void * user\_data, const double* rdist, 
VOL\_ivector\& sol)}

\noindent we solve the lagrangian problem.
We receive the data and reduced costs as input and return a primal vector. The
solution is in the vector {\tt sol}. Its first {\tt n} entries correspond to
the locations, then all remaining entries correspond to connections between
locations and customers.

In the function 

{\tt int UFL\_hook::compute\_rc(void * user\_data, const VOL\_dvector\& u, 
VOL\_dvector\& rc)}

\noindent we compute the reduced costs. They will be used to solve the
lagrangian problem. 

In the function 

\begin{verbatim}
   int 
   UFL_hook::solve_subproblem(void *user_data, 
                              const VOL_dvector& u, const VOL_dvector& rc,
                              double& lcost, VOL_dvector& x, 
                              VOL_dvector& v, double& pcost)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent we compute the lagrangian value, we call {\tt solve\_it}, we compute
the objective value and the vector $v$ defined as follows. If $\hat x$ is the
primal solution given by {\tt solve\_it}, and $Ax \sim b$ is the set of
relaxed constraints, then the difference $v$ is $$v = b - A \hat x.$$

The last function in this file is
\begin{verbatim}
   int 
   UFL_hook::heuristics(void * user_data, const VOL_problem& p,
                        const VOL_dvector& x, double& icost)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where we run the following simple heuristic. 
Given a fractional solution $(\bar x, \bar y)$, let $\bar y_i$ be the variable
associated with location $i$. We pick a random number $r \in [ 0, 1 ]$ and if
$r < \bar y_i$ facility $i$ is open, and closed otherwise. We repeat this for
every facility, then given the set of open facilities we find a minimum cost
assignment of customers. This function is invoked periodically in the VA and
by the main program after the VA has finished.
