The ufl example shows how to use the Volume Algorithm to find very good
solutions for the uncapacitated facility location problem. For further details
read the postscript documentatation in the doc subdirectory.

Prerequisites for installation:
  - make  
     - must use gnu make. 
  

To run ufl: 
  - edit ufl.par
    (the file 'data' contains a sample problem)
  - type ufl

Documentation on the ufl code can be found in the doc subdirectory. ufldoc.tex
is a latex2e file, from which a postscript file can be created by running the
following commands:
  latex ufldoc
  bibtex ufldoc
  latex ufldoc
  latex ufldoc
  dvips -o ufldoc.ps ufldoc
However, this is unnecessary, as the ufldoc.ps file is provided at the same
place...
