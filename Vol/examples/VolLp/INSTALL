The vollp example shows how to use the Volume algorithm to solve an LP (well,
to get an approximate solution). In fact, the very same code is in the heart
of the OsiVolSolverInterface code of Osi.

To build the vollp example of using Vol
  - Read and edit the ${CoinDir}/Makefiles/Makefile.location as necessary
  - Edit Makefile.vollp to set the optimization level
  - make  
     - must use gnu make. 
     - Targets are put in subdirectories.
       The name of the target subdirectory is derived using uname 
       command and some compiler flags.
 
To run vollp
  - ./TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY/vollp
    where TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY is the name of the subdirectory 
    containing the vollp executable.
    There are command line parameters. When none are specifed,
    help text describing the parameters is provided.
