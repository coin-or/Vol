The vollp example shows how to use the Volume algorithm to solve an LP (well,
to get an approximate solution). In fact, the very same code is in the heart
of the OsiVolSolverInterface code of Osi.

To build the vollp example of using Vol
  - make  
     - must use gnu make. 

 
To run vollp
  - ./vollp
    There are command line parameters. When none are specifed,
    help text describing the parameters is provided.
