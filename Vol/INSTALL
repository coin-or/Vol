Prerequisites for installation:
- must use gnu make
- to make the documentation doxygen must be installed

Targets are put in subdirectories, whose name is derived from the
platform name (as returned by `uname`) and the optimization level
(e.g., Linux-g).

To build the library archive for the Volume Algorithm:
  - read (and edit as needed) the top of the Makefile.
  - 'make' (same as 'make install') to create the libvol.so (or
    libvol.a) library archive in the target subdirectory and copies
    the headers into InstallDir/include and the library into
    InstallDir/lib.
  - 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes in the
    library and place them in doc/html.

For a detailed description on how to use the Volume Algorithm library,
read the documentation on the implementation for the uncapacitated
facility location (ufl) problem in the doc subdirectory. To see the
actual implementation of ufl check out the 'Examples' module.
