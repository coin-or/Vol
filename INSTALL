***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Vol package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "COIN-Vol", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Vol/trunk Coin-Vol

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/Vol and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip Vol_2006Jun07.tgz
   tar xvf Vol_2006Jun07.tar

   (Here "2006Jun07" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g.,
Coin-Vol or Vol_2006Jun07).  Then you type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the Vol Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Vol

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Vol successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the libraries and header
   files in the "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively. 

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   Vol/examples/

subdirectory, see also the information at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-examples



==== 8< ======================================================

From here on you find the original installation instructions for the
previous GNU Makefile build system.  Most details have changed, but
for now we keep it here so that possibly missing items might be found
here.

Prerequisites for installation:
- must use gnu make
- to make the documentation doxygen must be installed

Targets are put in subdirectories, whose name is derived from the
platform name (as returned by `uname`) and the optimization level
(e.g., Linux-g).

To build the library archive for the Volume Algorithm:
  - read (and edit as needed) the top of the Makefile.
  - 'make' (same as 'make install') to create the libvol.so (or
    libvol.a) library archive in the target subdirectory and copies
    the headers into InstallDir/include and the library into
    InstallDir/lib.
  - 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes in the
    library and place them in doc/html.

For a detailed description on how to use the Volume Algorithm library,
read the documentation on the implementation for the uncapacitated
facility location (ufl) problem in the doc subdirectory. To see the
actual implementation of ufl check out the 'Examples' module.
