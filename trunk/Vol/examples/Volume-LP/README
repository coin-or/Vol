To build type:
  make

The build process creates two subdirectories, "dep" and one whose name
combines the operating system name with the optimization level (e.g.,
Linux-O6).  "dep" contains dependency files that describe how the
source files depend on each other. "Linux-O6" contains the compiled
object files and the final executable named "volume-lp". Also a link
is created in the current directory to the final executable.

To run the code first you need to uncompress the input file:
  gunzip data.mps.gz

Then run the code as:
  ./volume-lp
